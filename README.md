## How to Play
Create skeet discs, throw them through the hoops, and shoot them before they hit the ground! 
Make the hoops appear by starting the timer. Time slows down when a disc goes through the hoop, and resumes when it is destroyed.
You have 30s to score as many points as possible. Try to beat your high score. The crowd is watching you!

### Controls
![Controls](Controls.png)
**LH**
trigger: Teleport, bottom round button: Spawn discs, side button: Grab discs  
**RH**  
trigger: Shoot, bottom round button: Start and Reset timer, side button: Grab gun 

## How to Grade
- Grabbing: Can grab discs and the gun
- Shooting: Can throw the discs after releasing the grab button. Discs fly in the natural direction that you released them.
- Teleporting: Use LH to teleport around the map
- Targets: The discs are the main targets. Hoops are secondary targets. Discs explode and hoops change colour for feedback.
- UI: Mini panel follows player's left hand, and highscore panel is prominently displayed on the game field.
- Audio: Crowds chanting, gun reloading, disc exploding, reverb zones, this game is full of audio!
- Creativity: Imagine playing basketball and skeet shooting in the matrix. That's the game. We also used scriptable objects as events to reduce coupling between scripts.
